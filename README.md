# CORE VERTICAL — Engineering & Applied Systems

This repository defines the Engineering & Applied Systems vertical for CORE.

It is a **cross-domain applied physics platform** that integrates multiple CORE engines
to evaluate engineered systems under real-world conditions.

This vertical is where physics becomes **engineering insight**, not guesswork.

---

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

This vertical intentionally composes across domains:

- KINETIC — structural mechanics, stress, vibration, fatigue
- ARES — acoustic amplification and damping
- THERMOS — heat transfer, expansion, thermal stress
- MAGNETAR — EM coupling in engineered systems
- HYDRA — fluid–structure interaction
- LITHOS — material composition and damping
- SIGNAL — anomaly detection, correlation, confidence metrics
- RGSR — multi-domain coupling and causality mapping

---

## Curated Real-World Phenomena

This vertical is curated to analyze engineered systems such as:

- bridges, buildings, and civil infrastructure
- vehicles, aircraft, and spacecraft structures
- industrial machinery and rotating systems
- pressure vessels and pipelines
- composite and layered material assemblies
- resonance-driven failure modes
- load amplification and stress concentration

Examples (non-exhaustive):
- resonance-induced fatigue
- thermal expansion cracking
- vibration amplification across joints
- EM-induced heating in structures
- fluid-driven oscillations and instability

## What This Vertical Is

- A **physics-first engineering analysis platform**
- A **failure precursor and safety interpretation system**
- A **design validation and stress-testing environment**

---

## What This Vertical Is NOT

- Not a CAD system
- Not a regulatory certification authority
- Not an engineering sign-off replacement
- Not an automated design generator

Engineering judgment remains human.

---

## Registries & Lenses (Maintained Here)

- Engineering system archetype registry
- Load and boundary condition libraries
- Material and composite property libraries
- Failure mode taxonomy
- Safety margin and tolerance schemas

---

## Output Requirements

Outputs must:
- identify dominant physics drivers
- label assumptions and simplifications
- include safety margins and uncertainty
- prohibit deterministic “pass/fail” claims without context

---

## Governance

This vertical is bound by CORE governance and audit rules.

All analyses are interpretive.
No operational control authority exists in this repository.
