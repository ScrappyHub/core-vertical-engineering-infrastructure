# CORE VERTICAL — Engineering & Infrastructure

This repository defines engineering and infrastructure interpretation layers for CORE.

It focuses on structural safety, resonance risk, material stress, and failure analysis.

## Scope
- Structural integrity interpretation
- Vibration and modal risk analysis
- Material fatigue indicators
- Safety threshold visualization
- Infrastructure lifecycle insights

## Non-Scope
- No physics solvers
- No permitting or regulatory authority
- No project management systems
- No governance overrides

## Architecture Position
Consumes outputs from KINETIC, ARES, LITHOS, THERMOS, and RGSR.

## Governance
Bound by CORE platform governance.
Any unsafe interpretation path must be gated or removed.
